OpenGL Basics with GLUT
=======================
This reposistory consists of C++ files that I wrote to practice OpenGL. It is useful for everyone starting with just core OpenGL. I start with drawing a window and then gradually move on to adding shapes, transformations and so on. 

Why not straight get into GLSL?
----
Whenever I have taught or TAed I get asked this question a lot. Yes, if you have some prior experience in graphics programming then ofcourse you could start off straight into GLSL but if not, it could be a bit overwhelming. Few reasons (you might disagree): 
- Graphics programming is not as straight forward at times since there are so many graphics cards out there. When you are programming for the first time and your code does not compile, it could be anything ranging from a typo in your code to adding compiler directives.
- Shader paradigm can be difficult to understand for those who havent taken any classes which discusses gpus.

Why GLUT?

Its simple.
